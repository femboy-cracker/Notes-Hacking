Custom scan : 

  If you want to experiment with a new TCP flag combination beyond the built-in TCP scan types, you can do so using --scanflags . For instance, if you want to set SYN, RST, and FIN simultaneously, you can do so using --scanflags RSTSYNFIN . As shown in the figure below, if you develop your custom scan, you need to know how the different ports will behave to interpret the results in different scenarios correctly.


Spoofing ips: 

  In general, you expect to specify the network interface using -e and to explicitly disable ping scan -Pn. Therefore, instead of nmap -S SPOOFED_IP 10.48.165.50, you will need to issue nmap -e NET_INTERFACE -Pn -S SPOOFED_IP 10.48.165.50 to tell Nmap explicitly which network interface to use and not to expect to receive a ping reply. It is worth repeating that this scan will be useless if the attacker system cannot monitor the network for responses. 


You can launch a decoy scan by specifying a specific or random IP address after -D. For example, nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,ME 10.48.165.50 will make the scan of 10.48.165.50 appear as coming from the IP addresses 10.10.0.1, 10.10.0.2, and then ME to indicate that your IP address should appear in the third order. Another example command would be nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,RND,RND,ME 10.48.165.50, where the third and fourth source IP addresses are assigned randomly, while the fifth source is going to be the attacker’s IP address. In other words, each time you execute the latter command, you would expect two new random IP addresses to be the third and fourth decoy sources.




Spoofing mac-addresses:

  When you are on the same subnet as the target machine, you would be able to spoof your MAC address as well. You can specify the source MAC address using --spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC. This address spoofing is only possible if the attacker and the target machine are on the same Ethernet (802.3) network or same WiFi (802.11).



Fragmented Packets

Nmap provides the option -f to fragment packets. Once chosen, the IP data will be divided into 8 bytes or less. Adding another -f (-f -f or -ff) will split the data into 16 byte-fragments instead of 8. You can change the default value by using the --mtu; however, you should always choose a multiple of 8.

To properly understand fragmentation, we need to look at the IP header in the figure below. It might look complicated at first, but we notice that we know most of its fields. In particular, notice the source address taking 32 bits (4 bytes) on the fourth row, while the destination address is taking another 4 bytes on the fifth row. The data that we will fragment across multiple packets is highlighted in red. To aid in the reassembly on the recipient side, IP uses the identification (ID) and fragment offset, shown on the second row of the figure below.
